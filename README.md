## My process

- Firstly, I downloaded the required starting images and guides for the project.
- Then I initialised Git for version control.
- Created an HTML file to set the structure right
- Then i used CSS to style it
  - Went to get the link required to deploy the required font [inter] on the webpage
  - Adjusted accordingly for the paragraphs using padding to look exactly like the design
- Finally, i made the webpage responsive to some chosen screen sizes without the use of media query.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Git & Github [forVersionControl]

### What I learned

I learnt that [place-content] attribute can sometimes not place the items in a [div] and all one needs could be [text-align].

The code snippet that I feel are noteworthy from this projects are:

```css
  .card {
  text-align: center;
}

```

### Continued development

I look forward to learning more on responsiveness and having my own personal full-stack developer website where people can get to know me as tho on a personal level. Also coupled with learning how to make my code shorter and cleaner.
